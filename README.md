# Project to Build a Chess Move Validation System by Quinn Barber and Yohan Hmaiti

### Involves all facets of modern day chess, with multiple moving parts

### Playable now. If you would like to, try a game!

### Accessible at https://quinn-barber.github.io/ChessEngine-QBarber-YHmaiti/

### If you would like to contribute, take a look at our issues and feel free to try to
### add to our code and send PRs to fix them! There are a lot of things happening, and the
### overall code needs to be refactored. Unfortunately, we are putting the project on hold
### and focusing on other things. So feel free to take a stab!
